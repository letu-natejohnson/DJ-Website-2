# DJ-Website-2

Second variation of the DJ-Website project

All client-side construction done in App2 folder.
All server-side construction done in serverTest4 folder.

These folders are intended to be modified intdependantly, changes in one should not effect the other.

TODO:

Fix gallery viewer.
* all gallery images should be loaded in via an array of image source references. Ignore SQL diagram, images will no longer be implemented via class wrappers.

Fix About page to load in text via a string representing a text file resource.

Identify any other content that may need to be changed by user-owner. All soft-content ought to be loaded in via either a resource reference string or a string
containing the content itself.
